1.1 is Unique
    Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structure?

1.2 Check Permutation
    Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

1.3 URLify
    Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,
    and that you are given the "true" length of the string

1.4 Palindrome Permutation
    Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
    A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwords.
    A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
    The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters
